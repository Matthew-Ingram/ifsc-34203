    <h2>My Assessment</h2> <!-- Hey Thomas! -->
    <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
    <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
    <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>
    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>
    <h4>Explain the difference between the &quot;alt&quot; attribute and the &quot;title&quot; attribute. </h4>
    <img src="assets/img/content-image2.jpg" alt="Image with the caption: I don't always use responsive design, but when I do, my mobile visitors can actually become customers">
    <p>The &quot;title&quot; attribute is intended to provide additional information about an element when hovered over, whereas the &quot;alt&quot; attribute is primarily for accessibility by providing a text description of an element (usually an image), such that text to speech programs can read out what the image is of.</p>
    <h4>Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <q>def&middot;i&middot;ni&middot;tion<br>1. a statement of the exact meaning of a word, especially in a dictionary.<br>2. the degree of distinctness in outline of an object, image, or sound, especially of an image in a photograph or on a screen.</q>
      <cite>Dictionary | Definitions from Oxford Languages</cite>
    </blockquote>
    <h4>Provide an example of link pointing to your favorite site &amp; create a style rule to change the background color of the link when the user hovers over it. </h4>
